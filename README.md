# Properati-s-project-II

Properati is a database with real estate information for Argentina. This project intends to create models of Machine Learning that can predict the price of a certain property. But, more important, tries to understand the given information and improve the performance of models with a correct transformation of data.

This project contains:

1 - Data transformation:

  ° Encoding
  
  ° Treatmen of Outliers
  
  ° Missing Values
  
  ° Standardize features



2 - Advanced Models

  ° XGBoost: Extreme Gradient Boosting
  
  ° PolynomialFeatures
  
  ° Regularization | Lasso, Ridge Regression
  
  ° Hyperparameters optimization



3 - Interpretation of models and conclusion
